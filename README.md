# DockerKubernetes

- Files inside ".github/workflows" and "menifest" folders are automatically created while deploying through "Azure Deployment center". 
These files can be edited later to change the names or parameters.
- workflow file is used in Actions to deploy the changes directly in Kubernetes cluster.
